# Combined Trigger Verifier Strategy

An advanced multi-signal strategy that combines multiple trigger indicators with verification filters to create a comprehensive trading system. Designed for sophisticated signal processing and maximum adaptability across different market conditions.

## Overview

The Combined Trigger Verifier strategy represents the most sophisticated approach in the system, using multiple trigger mechanisms combined with verification filters to generate high-confidence trading signals. It's designed for traders who want maximum signal processing power and adaptability.

## Strategy Logic

### Entry Signals
- **Long Entry**: BOTH conditions must be met:
  - At least one trigger fires: `all_triggers_long_or`
  - At least one verifier confirms: `all_verificators_long_or`

- **Short Entry**: BOTH conditions must be met:
  - At least one trigger fires: `all_triggers_short_or`
  - At least one verifier confirms: `all_verificators_short_or`

### Exit Signals
- **Long Exit**: Any exit condition met: `all_exits_long_or`
- **Short Exit**: Any exit condition met: `all_exits_short_or`

### Configuration
```python
"Combined_Trigger_Verifier": {
    "long_entry": ["all_triggers_long_or", "all_verificators_long_or"],
    "short_entry": ["all_triggers_short_or", "all_verificators_short_or"],
    "long_exit": ["all_exits_long_or"],
    "short_exit": ["all_exits_short_or"],
}
```

## Multi-Signal Architecture

### Trigger Signals (OR Logic)
Multiple trigger mechanisms that can independently initiate trades:
```python
all_triggers_long_or = (
    sma_crossover |           # Moving average crossover
    ema_crossover |           # EMA crossover  
    price_breaks_upper_band | # Bollinger Band breakout
    price_crosses_middle_band_from_bottom  # BB mean reversion
)
```

### Verification Signals (OR Logic)
Confirmation filters that validate trigger signals:
```python
all_verificators_long_or = (
    rsi_is_not_overbought    # RSI momentum filter
    # Additional verifiers can be added here
)
```

### Exit Signals (OR Logic)
Multiple exit mechanisms for flexible position management:
```python
all_exits_long_or = (
    sma_crossunder |          # Moving average reversal
    ema_crossunder |          # EMA reversal
    price_crosses_middle_band_from_top |  # BB mean reversion
    rsi_is_overbought         # RSI extreme level
)
```

## Why This Design?

### Flexibility
- **Multiple Entry Methods**: Can catch different types of market moves
- **Adaptive Confirmation**: Verification adjusts to market conditions
- **Diverse Exits**: Multiple ways to preserve profits and limit losses

### Robustness
- **Redundancy**: If one signal fails, others may still work
- **Market Adaptation**: Different signals work in different market regimes
- **Risk Distribution**: Not dependent on single indicator or method

### Sophistication
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced combination of multiple technical approaches
- **Conditional Logic**: Trigger-verifier architecture ensures quality
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Addresses trend, momentum, and volatility signals

## Signal Components

### Trend Signals
- **SMA Crossover/Crossunder**: Traditional trend following
- **EMA Crossover/Crossunder**: Responsive trend detection
- **Purpose**: Capture sustained directional moves

### Volatility Signals
- **BB Upper/Lower Breakouts**: Volatility expansion detection
- **BB Mean Reversion**: Return to normal volatility
- **Purpose**: Capture volatility cycle opportunities

### Momentum Signals
- **RSI Filters**: Momentum confirmation and extreme detection
- **MACD (can be added)**: Momentum and trend alignment
- **Purpose**: Ensure moves have momentum support

## Parameter Optimization

### Multi-Dimensional Space
The strategy has parameters from all component indicators:
- **SMA/EMA Periods**: Multiple moving average settings
- **Bollinger Bands**: Period and standard deviation
- **RSI Settings**: Period and overbought/oversold levels
- **Risk Management**: Stop loss and take profit parameters

### Optimization Challenges
```python
# Large parameter space example
total_combinations = (
    sma_period_range *      # e.g., 50 options
    ema_period_range *      # e.g., 50 options  
    bb_period_range *       # e.g., 20 options
    rsi_threshold_range *   # e.g., 30 options
    risk_mgmt_range         # e.g., 100 options
)  # = 150,000,000 combinations
```

feat: Implement volatile crypto reconciliation and frontend display improvements

This commit introduces the following changes:

- **Backend (PaperTradingEngine):**
  - Added logic to `analysis_task` to identify cryptos that are no longer in the volatile list.
  - For such cryptos, any open positions are closed, and they are removed from the `current_analysis_state`.
  - Modified the call to `get_volatile_cryptos` to refresh the cache every 1 hour, ensuring more up-to-date volatile crypto data.

- **Frontend (CurrentAnalysisTable):**
  - Replaced the "Position Size" column with "Position Value" to display the real-time value of open positions.
  - Changed the "Daily Change" column header to "Expected Profit (Backtest)" for clarity, as it reflects the backtest profit percentage.
